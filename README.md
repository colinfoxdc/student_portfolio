# student_portfolio
Project I have completed for my web development classes at Bowling Green State University 

The first project titled "bootstrap" was designed for me as a studnet to gain real world experience working with development 
framworks. The framework we used in my class at Bowling Green State University was Twitter's Bootstrap. 

The second project titled "flick picks" was one of the first sights I created completely from scrath for a project in my VCT 2660 class. The purpose of this projecet was learning to work with rows and columns, in the form of multiple page wrappers at different sizes, and also gaining experience working with <article> tags.

The last project listed, titled "modchipcentral" was a project intended to teach students how to work with different jquery plugins, such as the slider that I chose to use for my mock site.
